This was a super interesting flight.  Didn't think there was any lift to be had so wanted a quick one, but there was!  Decided to go and fly with a friend, Jess, who, managed to always be above me through the thermaling attempt.

She thinks, and the SportsTrackLive logs agree, that the thermal was more out front, over the trees, and I'm just not seeing them yet.  Would love to see how often I'm close, but "miss" the thermal
